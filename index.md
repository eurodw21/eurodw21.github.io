# Overview

The 15th EuroSys Doctoral Workshop (EuroDW 2021) will provide a forum for PhD students to present their work and receive constructive feedback from experts in the field as well as from peers. Technical presentations will be augmented with general advice and discussions about getting a PhD, doing research, and career perspectives. We invite applications from PhD students at any stage of their doctoral studies. EuroDW 2021 will also offer the opportunity for what we call “mentoring moments”. The idea is to give graduate students a chance to talk one-on-one (or, in some cases, one-on-two) about their research with outstanding researchers beyond those available at the students’ universities.

EuroDW 2021 has transformed into a virtual event, using the Zoom platform for streaming pre-recorded 5 min talks followed by 5 min live Q&A. We will additionally feature a #eurodw20 Slack channel in the main EuroSys Slack workspace where interaction can continue asynchronously during the workshop. We would like to thank our mentors who will provide remote mentoring to EuroDW students of accepted papers.

# Goal of the Workshop

The goal of the workshop is to provide feedback and advice to PhD students both on technical aspects of their research as well as career development. We expect a range of attendees such as the presenters’ peers, as well as senior researchers who will attend to share their expertise and provide constructive feedback. The idea is to create opportunities for students to meet with peers outside of their home institution, to get technical feedback as well as career advice from senior researchers in their field, to find out about internship and job opportunities, and to articulate their own work in a public, non-threatening forum. We encourage the participants to stay for the duration of the EuroSys main conference.

We expect most submissions to be from current PhD students who have selected a clear research topic. Research topics of interest include “systems” work in the broadest sense, including work on formal foundations, as well as the design, implementation and evaluation of real systems. Specifically, research topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Artificial intelligent systems
- Big data analytics frameworks
- Cloud computing and data center systems
- [Database systems
- Dependable systems
- Distributed systems
- File and storage systems
- Language support and runtime systems
- Mobile and pervasive systems
- Networked systems
- Operating systems
- Parallelism, concurrency, and multicore systems
- Real-time, embedded, and cyber-physical systems
- Secure systems, privacy and anonymity preserving systems
- Tracing, analysis, and transformation of systems
- Virtualization systems

**Note**: the workshop is not a venue for publication; there will be no published proceedings.

# Submission Instructions

If you would like to participate in the workshop, please submit your materials before the deadline. Submissions will receive written feedback from the PC, but the submission process is very lightweight and the main purpose is to put together the program and to match students with mentors.

Submission site: [https://eurodw21.hotcrp.com/](https://eurodw21.hotcrp.com/)

Submissions should be up to 2 pages (including title and figures but excluding references) and should include the following sections only:

- Abstract
- Introduction (problem statement, an overview of the proposed work, main differences from existing works)
- Overview of the proposed work
- Preliminary results (if applicable)
- Work to be done (description of the planned work to address the proposed research problem and brief timeline to PhD completion)
- Related work

Submissions will be accessed based on the importance, clarity and relevance to EuroSys of the research problem, excellent understanding of the core related work, realistic and clear roadmap to work completion towards the PhD, and overall quality of the submission paper.

Please note that there will be no published proceedings. Submissions shall be in .pdf, 2-column, single-spaced, 10pt format.

In addition, please include the following information in your submission form:

- PhD advisor’s name and affiliation
- Year when you started your PhD
- Expected submission date of the PhD thesis
